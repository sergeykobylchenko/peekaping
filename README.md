**A modern, self-hosted uptime monitoring solution**

Peekaping is a powerful, feature-rich uptime monitoring system similar to Uptime Kuma, built with Go and React. Monitor your websites, APIs, and services with real-time notifications, beautiful status pages, and comprehensive analytics.

## ⚠️ Beta Status

**Peekaping is currently in beta and actively being developed.** While I am excited to share this project with the community, please note that:

- The software is still undergoing testing and refinement
- Some features may be incomplete or subject to change
- I recommend testing in non-production environments first
- Please report any issues you encounter - your feedback helps us improve!

We encourage you to try Peekaping and provide feedback, but please use it at your own discretion. Your testing and feedback are invaluable to making Peekaping production-ready! 🚀

## 💡 Motivation

Peekaping is designed as a modern alternative to Uptime Kuma, built with a focus on **strongly typed architecture** and **extensibility**. Our server is written in Go, a fast and efficient language that enables a small footprint while maintaining high performance. The codebase is structured for easy extensibility, allowing developers to seamlessly add new notification channels, monitor types, and even swap out the database layer without major refactoring.

The client-side application is also strongly typed and built with modern React patterns, making it equally extensible and maintainable. This combination of type safety, performance, and modular design makes Peekaping an ideal choice for teams who need a reliable, customizable uptime monitoring solution.

# Docker Compose Files

### docker-compose.dev.{db}.yml
These files are for local testing and build the entire stack locally from Dockerfiles

### docker-compose.prod.{db}.yml
These files are production-ready configurations that pull pre-built containers from Docker Hub

### docker-compose.{db}.yml
These files run standalone databases for local development, designed to work with `turbo run dev`

## 🛠 Development Setup

### Full Stack Development
**Create environment file in root:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Install all dependencies
pnpm install

# run turbo
turbo run dev docs:watch
```


## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
DB_NAME=peekaping # file path for sqlite like /app/data/peekaping.db)
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=6001
DB_TYPE=mongo # postges | mysql |sqlite

PORT=8034
CLIENT_URL="http://localhost:5173"
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRED_IN=1m
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET_KEY=secret-key
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRED_IN=60m

## 🔒 Security

### Authentication
- JWT-based authentication
- Optional 2FA with TOTP
- Secure session management

### Best Practices
- Use strong passwords and JWT secrets
- Regular security updates
- Secure your db instance
- Use HTTPS in production

### Reverse Proxy Setup

Example Nginx configuration included in `nginx.conf`.
